Welcome all, to the new (but not yet improved) website!

There is still much to be added here, but keep a close eye! I'm already working on the first true blogpost (a YouTube tutorial with a linked read-along post), and hopefully much more! I still need to yet add social media icons and some more flair, but this is a good start!

Too many hobbies can't be dangerous, right? What's one more in web development?
